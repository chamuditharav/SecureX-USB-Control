# SecureX-USB-Control

## Introduction

###### Data leakage is one of the critical threats that can be present in an organization. Data breach can lead businesses even to bankruptcy. Data leakage can happen due to mistakes done by internal staff members as well as outsiders. One of the main ways of data leakage is poor removable device policy within the organization. USB Mass Storage devices are the number one option that data can leak via removable media.

###### In organizations, users must be able to use only allowed USB storage devices. Organizations use Active Directory for managing their employees. Active Directory is only able to block USB devices regardless of the user/user group. Active Directory features a device-based USB device control. 

###### SecureX USB Agent is a User/User group-based USB device control agent. SeureX USB Agent features multiple failsafe mechanisms to ensure that no unauthorized USB device is used within the organization. It is capable of working with an Active Directory or standalone agent. It has the ability to whitelist any users or USB device according to product ID or Vender ID. Since the agent has a small footprint and takes very little resources, the user is able to work without any interruption. The installation features a silent mode which makes easier for IT administrator to push the agent via a SSCM.
